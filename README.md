# self-edu-library
> An open-source library of toolkits, frameworks, methods, and strategies for [self-education](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-90675-6).

I used to run into this problem: I wanted to learn things, but most resources either spoon-fed me content or left me completely on my own. I needed something in between—tools for _how_ to learn, not just _what_ to learn.

So I'm building this library. It's a open place of frameworks, strategies, methods, and toolkits that help with self-education. The kind of stuff I wish someone had told me earlier, like:
- How do you even approach learning something when you don't know where to start?
- How do you develop judgment about what's worth your time?

This isn't a course. There's no curriculum, no path you have to follow. It's more like a real library: browse around, take what's useful, ignore the rest, and share what you learned if you want.

I'm starting with what I know from my own experience in self-education, as well as research in how people learn. But this only works if other people add what they've learned too. When you figure something out about learning, write it down. Not because you're an expert, but because explaining it helps you understand it better. That's how this library grows.

_**No prerequisites. No tests. No obligation. No certificates or badges**. Just tools for curious people who want to learn on their own terms and who are willing to experiment_.
