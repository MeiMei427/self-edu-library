# self-edu-library
> An open-source library of toolkits, frameworks, methods, and strategies for [self-education](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-90675-6) (learning is initiated and guided by the one's curiosity and exercised agency, rather than by uncritical compliance with externally imposed curricula or norms.)

I used to run into this problem: I wanted to learn things, but most resources either spoon-fed me content or left me completely on my own. I needed something in between: tools for _how_ to learn, not just _what_ to learn.

So I'm building this library. It's a place of frameworks, strategies, methods, and toolkits that help with self-education. This isn't a course. There's no curriculum, no path you have to follow. It's more like a real library: browse around, take what's useful, ignore the rest, and share what you learned if you want. It has the kind of stuff I wish someone had told me earlier, like:

- How do I even approach learning something when I don't know where to start?
- How do I develop intuition/judgment about what's worth my time?
- How do I build mental models that actually stick instead of evaporating a week later?
- How do one sees patterns/connections that other miss, and how do I train myself to notice them?
- When I got stuck, how do I figure out if I need more examples, a different framework, or just time to sit with confusion?

These are the meta-level stuff that's rarely taught explicitly and clearly but makes a huge difference.

I'm starting with what I know from my own experience in self-education, as well as research in human learning. But this only works if other people add what they've learned too. When you figure something out about learning, write it down. Not because you're an expert, but because explaining it helps you understand it better. That's how this library grows.

_**No prerequisites. No tests. No obligation. No certificates or badges**. Just tools for curious people who want to learn on their own terms and who are willing to experiment_.
